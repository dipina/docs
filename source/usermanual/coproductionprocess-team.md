# Team management in co-production process

Before using the Collaborative environment, you must first login with your google credentials or create your own credentials at [https://demo.interlink-project.eu/](https://demo.interlink-project.eu/), i.e. the staging server of INTERLINK. Alternatively, you may do this process in your pilot server:
- [https://mef.interlink-project.eu/](https://mef.interlink-project.eu/)
- [https://varam.interlink-project.eu/](https://varam.interlink-project.eu/)
- [https://zgz.interlink-project.eu/](https://zgz.interlink-project.eu/)
**IMPORTANT**: All members of an envisaged team must logged into the platform before they can be added to a team. ![Login required screen](images/image0.PNG) ![AAC screen](images/image1.PNG)

Next, create a team which wants to take part in a co-production process. In the figure you can see how to members of a team first log in and then they are assigned to the same team. ![Two user sessions](images/image2.PNG) ![Creating a team](images/image3.png) ![Adding a user](images/image4.png) ![Team editing window](images/image5.png)

The main purpose of a team in the Collaborative Environment is to take part in a co-production process. Consequently, we need to create a co-production project where the activity to co-create will be managed ![Creating a new co-production project](images/image6.png)

Finally, you have to link the created team to the created co-production process. ![Select Team menu option and "Add new Team" button](images/image8.png) ![Click on pop-up window's Add team button](images/image9.png)
